`As human-beings, passions are what drives our decisions.`,
`As a kid, I used to think about what I was going to be when I grew up. I would think
about cool people that had jobs doing the things that I loved to do. My interests at
the time were building Legos and being outside at the beautiful beaches of Southern California.`,
`Over time, I had to give up on the first one :( , but I was excited to make a career out of
protecting the natural environment that I enjoyed so much.
`,
`After graduating from Oregon State University with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences
(with an emphasis in Water Resources), I was determined to become an engineer. Over the next year,
I used free material on YouTube to teach myself subjects like Physics, Calculus, and industry-related
mathematics in order to take the California Fundementals of Engineering exam. The early mornings and
sleepless nights paid off, though; I passed on the first attempt and was ready to become an engineer.
`,
`There was a problem: I was unhappy. In the 5 years that led up to this point, I had sacrificed life
experiences for studying and grinding. I had not had the chance to experience life and get to know myself.
How was I supposed to feel a sense of purpose if I didn't even know who I was? I decided that
it was time to take some time away from my professional aspirations and figure out who I was and what I wanted.
`,
`So..
`,
`I quit my job.`,
`I packed up my stuff`,
`I bought a one-way ticket to Peru.`,
`Over the next 2 years, I would travel to 11 countries and learn alot: how to speak 2 new languages fluently,
the feeling of standing on a mountain summit with nobody around, the subtleties of Calena salsa dancing, how
your shins feel after 4 months of training Muay Thai everyday in Thailand (PAIN!)... I could go on and on,
but the memories far surpass the amount of space on this page. After returning to Southern California, I felt
connected with myself and, more importantly, I was ready to build something for myself. What that 'something'
was, I was not sure.
`,
`I came back to career where I started learning Python. I loved the logic used for creating data flows and that I could
process thousands of data points with a single function call. I couldn't stop learning. I was spending hours a day of my
free time building programs to help my engineering work and automate my life. As my engineering work required me to create
graphics and visuals for complex data, I transitiioned into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. IT WAS LIKE I WAS BUILDING
WITH LEGOS AGAIN. Only these Legos were digital. Each <div> I created and <p> element I nested brought back the joy I felt
assembling the Lego villages I made as a kid. I was hooked. I started thinking that I could make a career out of building
beautiful websites with these digital Legos. My passion was back. I DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE UP MY CHILDHOOD PASSION.
`,
`So here I am. A JavaScript Full-Stack Software Engineer that uses digital Legos (React.js (front-end), Express.js (middleware), and PostgreSQL
(back-end)) to create reactive web applications and RESTfulAPIs.
`,
`I am always eager to explore new opportunities that allow me to apply the skills that I have built and learn new technologies.
`,
`If my story resonated with you at all, I would love to have coffee (or drinks) and talk more. Feel free to send me a message
on any platform on the Contact Me page (via the 'Let's Talk' link).
`,
`Thanks for your time and we'll talk soon!
