-conditions:
  --N divisible by divisor
  --N <= bound
  --N > 0

-set 2 variables = 1: counter and ret
-set up while loop: (while ret <= bound) multiply counter by
divisor check counter*divisor is still
<= bound
    -- if (counter*divisor > bound) ? return ret
          : ret = counter*divisor && counter++
