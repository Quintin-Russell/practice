2 vars: n = step # and m = max number of steps you can go at one time

1) initialize an array of length n and fill it w/ placeholders
2) initialize:
  -a running sum variable
  -the value at index 0 = 1
3) for loop starting at index 1:
  * for each index of the array:
    -initialize 2 variables
      -- s = index - max # of steps at once - 1
      -- e = index - 1
    -check if s >= 0 => subtract array[s] from running sum
    -add array[e] to running sum

return the last element of the array
