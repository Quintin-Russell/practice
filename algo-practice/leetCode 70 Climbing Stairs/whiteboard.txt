2 vars: n = step # and m = max number of steps you can go at one time

1) initialize an array of length n and fill it w/ placeholders
2) initialize:
  -a running sum variable
  -the value at index 0 = 1
3) for loop starting at index 1:
  * for each index of the array:
    -initialize 2 variables
      -- s = index - max # of steps at once - 1
      -- e = index - 1
    if the previous index - the max # of steps > 0, we want to subtract
    the array at that index from the running sum

    we then add the previous index to the running sum and assign that to the
    array at the current index
    -check if s >= 0 => subtract array[s] from running sum
    -add array[e] to running sum

return the last element of the array
