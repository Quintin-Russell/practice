common ?s: given n things, how many combinations can we make;
  how many ways can we do x; shortest way to do x
-all possible combos = 2**n
  --base 2 bc all decisions on logic tree are binary: either include
    or not
-base case: smallest case of input where "you already know the answer"
  --ex) empty array
  --check for base case at beginning: return [] if input.length === 0
1) grab first elment of arr and assign to variable
2) slice arr and assign returned arr to a varible
3) find combos w/ sliced arr w/ arr; find combos w/out first
