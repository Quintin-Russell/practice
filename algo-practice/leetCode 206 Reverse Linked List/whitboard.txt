Linked list = NOT AN ARRAY
  --dynamic size
  --efficient insertion and deletion
  --no random access
  --no waste of memory
  --each member of a linked list = an obj;
    -2 properties: data and next
      --data = value
      --next = the next box in the linked list
  --connections go in 1 direction, but not the other
    --can find next member easily, but hard to find the previous
iteratively:
-itterate through the rray of length n using a traditional for loop
  *for each:
    --ad OGarr[i] to newArr[-x-1]
